# Python Web Scraper

This is a simple web scraper to download text from a website. The content will be written to two text files in the `output` folder.
- Content.txt
- Headers.txt

## Environment File

The environment file contains 3 values

```
BASE_URL=Base URL of the content
HEADER_SLUGS=Slug containing the headers
CONTENT_SLUGS=Slug containing all the content
```

## IDE

I use [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) as my IDE. Really nice UI, similar to Rider. You can also just run the solution from within PyCharm.

## Setup

### TL;DR

- Download and install [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Install `requirements.txt` - `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the command - `python3 main.py`
